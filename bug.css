This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with a class that contains a pseudo-selector, such as `hover`, `focus`, or `active`.  The `@apply` directive might not correctly apply the styles defined within the class to the target element when the specific pseudo-selector state is triggered.

For example:

```css
.btn {
  @apply bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded;
  @apply hover:bg-blue-700;
}
```

In this case, the `hover:bg-blue-700` might not change the background color when the button is hovered. This is because pseudo-selectors are often resolved at a later stage of the CSS processing, after `@apply` has already been processed.
